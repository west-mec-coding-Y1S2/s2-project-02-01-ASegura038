                    I hired Jedds to remove an old Sugar maple from a narrow yard. They did the job with no damage tomy garage and cleaned it
                    all up that same day. Great service. --- Kevin S (Dewitt)

                    Jedds Tree Care promptly came to examine a downed tree and provide an estimate for its removal. They did the job fast and
                    at the lowest bid. I'll call them again without hesitation for future lawn and garden needs. --- Ann
